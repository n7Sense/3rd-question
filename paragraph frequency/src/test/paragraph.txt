Vishnu is the second god in the Hindu triumvirate or Trimurti. The triumvirate consists of three gods who are responsible for the creation, 
upkeep and destruction of the world. The other two gods are Brahma and Shiva.

Brahma is the creator of the universe and Shiva is the destroyer. Vishnu is the preserver and protector of the universe.

His role is to return to the earth in troubled times and restore the balance of good and evil. So far, he has been incarnated nine times,
but Hindus believe that he will be reincarnated one last time close to the end of this world.

Vishnu worship pers, usually called Vaishnava, consider him the greatest god. They regard the other gods as lesser or demi gods.
Vaishnava worship only Vishnu. Vishnu monotheism is called Vaishnavism.
